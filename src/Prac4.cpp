 * Thread that handles writing to SPI

 * You must pause writing to SPI if not playing is true (the player is paused)
 * When calling the function to write to SPI, take note of the last argument.
 * You don't need to use the returned value from the wiring pi SPI function
 * You need to use the buffer_location variable to check when you need to switch buffers
